## Summary/Findings
As a financial advisor I wanted to create something I use on a daily basis for my clients. My motivation was very high because I could create something that would benefit me and my customers. So high was the pride when I finished writing.

## Review
- Are there things that should be done differently?  
    In addition, I could add other payments. And with Matplotlib or Seaborn you could add graphs.
- How can this be used in the future?  
    I can expand this program and use it for my clients.
- Anything else?
    I will clearly extend this program and create it more customer friendly with an interface etc.
